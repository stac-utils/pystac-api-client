Usage
#####

PySTAC-Client (pystac-client) builds upon
`PySTAC <https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac>`_ library to add support
for STAC APIs in addition to static STAC catalogs. PySTAC-Client can be used with static
or dynamic (i.e., API) catalogs. Currently, pystac-client does not offer much in the way
of additional functionality if using with static catalogs, as the additional features
are for support STAC API endpoints such as `search`. However, in the future it is
expected that pystac-client will offer additional convenience functions that may be
useful for static and dynamic catalogs alike.

The most basic implementation of a STAC API is an endpoint that returns a valid STAC
Catalog, but also contains a ``"conformsTo"`` attribute that is a list of conformance
URIs for the standards that the API supports.

This section is organized by the classes that are used, which mirror parent classes
from PySTAC:

+------------------+------------+
| pystac-client    | pystac     |
+==================+============+
| Client           | Catalog    |
+------------------+------------+
| CollectionClient | Collection |
+------------------+------------+

The classes offer all of the same functions for accessing and traversing Catalogs as
in PySTAC. The documentation for pystac-client only includes new functions, it does
not duplicate documentation for inherited functions.

Client
++++++

The :class:`pystac_client.Client` class is the main interface for working with services
that conform to the STAC API spec. This class inherits from the :class:`pystac.Catalog`
class and in addition to the methods and attributes implemented by a Catalog, it also
includes convenience methods and attributes for:

* Checking conformance to various specs
* Querying a search endpoint (if the API conforms to the STAC API - Item Search spec)

The preferred way to interact with any STAC Catalog or API is to create an
:class:`pystac_client.Client` instance with the ``pystac_client.Client.open`` method
on a root Catalog. This calls the :meth:`pystac.STACObject.from_file` except
properly configures conformance and IO for reading from remote servers.

The following code creates an instance by making a call to the Microsoft Planetary
Computer root catalog.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pystac_client.Client import Client
    >>> api = Client.open('https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1')
    >>> api.title
    'microsoft-pc'

Some functions, such as ``Client.search`` will throw an error if the provided
Catalog/API does not support the required Conformance Class. In other cases,
such as ``Client.get_collections``, API endpoints will be used if the API
conforms, otherwise it will fall back to default behavior provided by
:class:`pystac.Catalog`.

Users may optionally provide an ``ignore_conformance`` argument when opening,
in which case pystac-client will not check for conformance and will assume
this is a fully featured API. This can cause unusual errors to be thrown if the API
does not in fact conform to the expected behavior.

In addition to the methods and attributes inherited from :class:`pystac.Catalog`,
this class offers more efficient methods (if used with an API) for getting collections
and items, as well as a search capability, utilizing the
:class:`pystac_client.ItemSearch` class.

API Conformance
---------------

This library is intended to work with any STAC static catalog or STAC API. A static
catalog will be usable more or less the same as with PySTAC, except that pystac-client
supports providing custom headers to API endpoints. (e.g., authenticating
to an API with a token).

A STAC API is a STAC Catalog that is required to advertise its capabilities in a
`conformsTo` field and implements the `STAC API - Core` spec along with other
optional specifications:

* `STAC API - Core <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/core>`__
* `STAC API - Item Search <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/item-search>`__
   * `Fields Extension <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/fragments/fields>`__
   * `Query Extension <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/fragments/query>`__
   * `Sort Extension <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/fragments/sort>`__
   * `Context Extension <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/fragments/context>`__
   * `Filter Extension <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/fragments/filter>`__
* `STAC API - Features <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/ogcapi-features>`__ (based on
  `OGC API - Features <https://www.ogc.org/standards/ogcapi-features>`__)

The :meth:`pystac_client.Client.conforms_to` method is used to check conformance
against conformance classes (specs). To check an API for support for a given spec,
pass the `conforms_to` function the :class:`ConformanceClasses` attribute as a
parameter.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pystac_client import ConformanceClasses
    >>> api.conforms_to(ConformanceClasses.STAC_API_ITEM_SEARCH)
    True

CollectionClient
++++++++++++++++

STAC APIs may provide a curated list of catalogs and collections via their ``"links"``
attribute. Links with a ``"rel"`` type of ``"child"`` represent catalogs or collections
provided by the API. Since :class:`~pystac_client.Client` instances are also
:class:`pystac.Catalog` instances, we can use the methods defined on that class to
get collections:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> child_links = api.get_links('child')
    >>> len(child_links)
    12
    >>> first_child_link = api.get_single_link('child')
    >>> first_child_link.resolve_stac_object(api)
    >>> first_collection = first_child_link.target
    >>> first_collection.title
    'Landsat 8 C1 T1'

CollectionClient overrides the :meth:`pystac.Collection.get_items` method. PySTAC will
get items by iterating through all children until it gets to an `item` link. If the
`CollectionClient` instance contains an `items` link, this will instead iterate through
items using the API endpoint instead: `/collections/<collection_id>/items`. If no such
link is present it will fall back to the PySTAC Collection behavior.


ItemSearch
++++++++++

STAC API services may optionally implement a ``/search`` endpoint as describe in the
`STAC API - Item Search spec
<https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/item-search>`__. This
endpoint allows clients to query STAC Items across the entire service using a variety
of filter parameters. See the `Query Parameter Table
<https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/item-search#query-parameter-table>`__
from that spec for details on the meaning of each parameter.

The :meth:`pystac_client.Client.search` method provides an interface for making
requests to a service's "search" endpoint. This method returns a
:class:`pystac_client.ItemSearch` instance.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pystac_client import Client
    >>> api = Client.open('https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1')
    >>> results = api.search(
    ...     max_items=5
    ...     bbox=[-73.21, 43.99, -73.12, 44.05],
    ...     datetime=['2019-01-01T00:00:00Z', '2019-01-02T00:00:00Z'],
    ... )

Instances of :class:`~pystac_client.ItemSearch` a handful of methods for
getting matching items. The method to use depends on how many of the matches you
want to consume (a single item at a time, a page at a time, or everything)
and whether you want "raw" Python dictionaries representing the items, or
proper ``pystac`` objects.

* :meth:`ItemCollection.items()` returns an iterator over individual items,
  each being a :class:`pystac.Item`.
* :meth:`ItemCollection.items_as_dicts()` returns an iterator over individual
  items, each being an item-like :class:`dict`.
* :meth:`ItemCollection.pages()` returns an iterator over pages of the
  matching items, each being a :class:`pystac.ItemCollection`
* :meth:`ItemCollection.pages_as_dicts()` returns an iterator over pages of the
  matching items, each being feature-collection-like :class:`dict`.
* :meth:`ItemCollection.item_collection()` returns all of the matching items
  as a single :class:`pystac.ItemCollection`
* :meth:`ItemCollection.item_collection_as_dict()` returns  all of the matching
  items as a single feature-collection-like :class:`dict`.

Additionally, the ``matched`` method can be used to access result metadata about
how many total items matched the query:

* :meth:`ItemSearch.matched <pystac_client.ItemSearch.matched>`: returns the number
  of hits (items) for this search if the API supports the STAC API Context Extension.
  Not all APIs support returning a total count, in which case a warning will be issued.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> for item in results.items():
    ...     print(item.id)
    S2B_OPER_MSI_L2A_TL_SGS__20190101T200120_A009518_T18TXP_N02.11
    MCD43A4.A2019010.h12v04.006.2019022234410
    MCD43A4.A2019009.h12v04.006.2019022222645
    MYD11A1.A2019002.h12v04.006.2019003174703
    MYD11A1.A2019001.h12v04.006.2019002165238

The :meth:`~pystac_client.ItemSearch.items` and related methods handle retrieval of
successive pages of results
by finding links with a ``"rel"`` type of ``"next"`` and parsing them to construct the
next request. The default
implementation of this ``"next"`` link parsing assumes that the link follows the spec for
an extended STAC link as
described in the
`STAC API - Item Search: Paging <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/item-search#paging>`__
section. See the :mod:`Paging <pystac_client.paging>` docs for details on how to
customize this behavior.

Alternatively, the Items can be returned within ItemCollections, where each
ItemCollection is one page of results retrieved from search:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> for ic in results.pages():
    ...     for item in ic.items:
    ...         print(item.id)
    S2B_OPER_MSI_L2A_TL_SGS__20190101T200120_A009518_T18TXP_N02.11
    MCD43A4.A2019010.h12v04.006.2019022234410
    MCD43A4.A2019009.h12v04.006.2019022222645
    MYD11A1.A2019002.h12v04.006.2019003174703
    MYD11A1.A2019001.h12v04.006.2019002165238

If you do not need the :class:`pystac.Item` instances, you can instead use
:meth:`ItemSearch.items_as_dicts <pystac_client.ItemSearch.items_as_dicts>`
to retrieve dictionary representation of the items, without incurring the cost of
creating the Item objects.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> for item_dict in results.items_as_dicts():
    ...     print(item_dict["id"])
    S2B_OPER_MSI_L2A_TL_SGS__20190101T200120_A009518_T18TXP_N02.11
    MCD43A4.A2019010.h12v04.006.2019022234410
    MCD43A4.A2019009.h12v04.006.2019022222645
    MYD11A1.A2019002.h12v04.006.2019003174703
    MYD11A1.A2019001.h12v04.006.2019002165238

Query Extension
---------------

If the Catalog supports the `Query
extension <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/fragments/query>`__,
any Item property can also be included in the search. Rather than
requiring the JSON syntax the Query extension uses, pystac-client can use a
simpler syntax that it will translate to the JSON equivalent. Note
however that when the simple syntax is used it sends all property values
to the server as strings, except for ``gsd`` which it casts to
``float``. This means that if there are extensions in use with numeric
properties these will be sent as strings. Some servers may automatically
cast this to the appropriate data type, others may not.

The query filter will also accept complete JSON as per the specification.

::

  <property><operator><value>

  where operator is one of `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `=`

  Examples:
  eo:cloud_cover<10
  view:off_nadir<50
  platform=landsat-8

Any number of properties can be included, and each can be included more
than once to use additional operators.

Sort Extension
---------------

If the Catalog supports the `Sort
extension <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/fragments/sort>`__,
the search request can specify the order in which the results should be sorted with
the ``sortby`` parameter.  The ``sortby`` parameter can either be a string
(e.g., ``"-properties.datetime,+id,collection"``), a list of strings
(e.g., ``["-properties.datetime", "+id", "+collection"]``), or a dictionary representing
the POST JSON format of sortby. In the string and list formats, a ``-`` prefix means a
descending sort and a ``+`` prefix or no prefix means an ascending sort.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pystac_client import Client
    >>> results = Client.open('https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1').search(
    ...     sortby="properties.datetime"
    ... )
    >>> results = Client.open('https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1').search(
    ...     sortby="-properties.datetime,+id,+collection"
    ... )
    >>> results = Client.open('https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1').search(
    ...     sortby=["-properties.datetime", "+id" , "+collection" ]
    ... )
    >>> results = Client.open('https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1').search(
    ...     sortby=[
                {"direction": "desc", "field": "properties.datetime"},
                {"direction": "asc", "field": "id"},
                {"direction": "asc", "field": "collection"},
            ]
    ... )
